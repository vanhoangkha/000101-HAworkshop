### Introduce
In this exercise, we will conduct the deployment of a Wordpress application with Auto Scaling Group to ensure the scalability of the application according to the needs of the visitors. In addition, we will also implement a Load Balancer to balance the load and coordinate user access requests to our Application Tier. In addition, use the Amazon CloudFront service for the most effective application.

With the Database Instance (DB) part, we will deploy the database on Multi AZ and take a DB snapshot to facilitate Roll Back as well as ensure data availability (Multi AZ).
